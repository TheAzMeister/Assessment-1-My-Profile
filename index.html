    <h1>Assessment 1 My Profile </h1>
      <h4>Aaron Still s3901204</h4>
      <h2><strong> Personal Information</strong> </h2>
        <h3><strong>Why did i choose to come to RMIT?</strong> </h3>
          <p style="font">There are multiple reasons as to why I chose to come to RMIT. I had friends that came here, and they all had nothing but wonderful things to say about the university. I was told about all the help and support they were given during their studies as well as how professional and great the staff were. The teachers did everything they could to help all the students. Another reason for attending RMIT is that it’s quite easy to get to via public transport. I live an hour out of Melbourne and so I want the commute to university to be easy and stress free. I also didn’t want to be getting home at crazy hours of the night. One of the biggest reasons is that my Mum came to RMIT, and she loved it. I thought that it would make her proud if I came here.</p>
        <h3><strong>What do i expect to learn from my studies?</strong></h3>
          <p> I am studying the Bachelor of Information Technology so I am expecting to learn sorts of skills that will help me get a job in the IT industry as well as learning everything there is to know about computers. I expect to learn how software is made and how to make it. As well as learning how software and hardware work together to make the computer run. I want to learn how to program in all kinds of languages such as Python, HTML and Java. I even expect to learn skills that aren’t completely related to computers like how to communicate with customers, how to communicate with co workers and how to work effectively in a team.</p>
      <h2> <strong> Interest in IT </strong> </h2>
        <p> I have always enjoyed messing around with computers and trying to troubleshoot problems on them. I have always been the person that my family comes to when there’s a problem with the computers in the house and I have always enjoyed trying to figure out what is wrong with the computer and how I can fix it. I would learn something new every time I fixed a computer, and I was always finding newer and easier ways to fix problems and sometimes I would erase problems entirely. In year 9 I did an IT class, and it was a lot of fun, we learnt a little bit of HTML and I knew after that, that I wanted to continue learning it however I did not continue with the classes as it was clear that the teachers didn’t know what they were doing, and I didn’t want them to ruin my enjoyment of the subject. In 2021 I built my own computer and even though it was stressful as I was paranoid about breaking every piece, I had a blast building it. It was fascinating learning about each component when I was deciding which ones I wanted. Now I have my own pc that I feel immensely proud of every time I look at it. I would love to be able to look at another thing that I made such as a program or a website and be able to have that same feeling. </p>
<h2> <strong>Ideal Job</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/57976690?type=standard#sol=5560384ff138d46b628451e419d681a7012b85c0">IT Systems Administrator</a></strong></h3>
<img src="Images/Seek Job.png" alt="Seek job description">
<p>In this position I would be supporting all its systems in the office so that they perform optimally for the users. I will also provide maintenance for all the systems, and I will provide help for anyone that needs it including customers and employees. I will need to monitor the performance of all the systems, and I will have to create reports on how they are running whether that is if they’re working fine or if there are any errors. This role appeals to me as I would be able to use my expertise in IT to make other peoples lives easier and to help people. It also sounds like there might be a lot of problems to solve which is great because I am always up for a challenge. It might be a little stressful to have everyone rely on me but when everything is running smoothly, I would be so proud of myself and everything I had accomplished. In order to get this role, I would need 3-5 years of experience in a lot of areas. Like managing and supporting servers, using VMWare (Cloud software), creating networks. Installing, updating, and maintaining servers. Solve problems with servers, helping clients, design and creating web applications and creating scripts. I currently have none of these skills or qualifications. In order to gain these qualifications, I will first need to finish my course and get my bachelors. I will then need to find an entry level job in IT whether that’s a specific role or an internship. Then I will work hard and learn as much as possible. Maybe the business has the potential to progress my career and I can take on new responsibilities or get a promotion. Or I can look for another job in a more specific area to gain new skills. Finally, after a few years in will be able to become an IT Systems Administrator. </p>

      <h3><strong>Creativity Test</strong></h3>
<img src="Images/Creativity Test.png" alt="">
        <p> In the Myers and Briggs test and the Learn style quiz show that I am very introverted and that I’m relaxed and sit back and observe people. I would say that these are accurate but no 100% as my answers to these questions could change on any day. When reading the description for the logistician it described me quite well and my learning style test will help me to improve my study methods. The creativity test showed me pretty much what I already knew. These results show that I can work well in a team, but I would be quiet and would not be the person leading the team. I will show my ideas to my team, and I will listen to theirs and I will be easy to get along with. When forming a team, I could look for people who are able to cover for my weaknesses like people who are good at talking and are fine with taking charge. I could also look for people who are like me as we might get along well and always be able to understand each other clearly and there won’t be any miscommunication. </p>
    <h2> <strong> Project Idea</strong> </h2>
    <p>I want to create a program that searches the internet for information about any game ever made and put it on one place. All the information could be viewable via a website or app. The database will hold basic information about games like the cast, who made it, trailers as well as more technical stuff like a list of every update the game has had with a list of patch notes. It will even have information about what development was like. It will automatically search the web to find interviews and articles about the game and its developers. The aim is to have as much information about a game in one place. </p>
    <p>In the future it is entirely possible that we may never be able to play the games we love in a legal way. This may be due to companies removing the servers from games or removing internet access to consoles so we can’t update games, or like what Ubisoft are doing, making it so you can’t download games and DLC ever again. If you don’t own a physical copy of a game, then there is a chance that it may be taken off steam or origin and you may never be able to play it again as legally we don’t own these games, we rent them from these companies so they can do whatever they want with them. I don’t want any games to be lost to history.
    </p>
    <p>The user will search up any game they want, and they will be greeted with a page of information about the game. The program will search the internet looking for certain material about the game and display it on a website/app. Basic stuff like developers, cast, credits, publisher, suggestions, and reviews will show up. But more important and interesting thigs will show up like a list of every patch along with gameplay for each patch, list of known bugs, interviews on certain topics from developers, places you can buy it, deals for it, details about whether the game is available anymore, and many more. The program will try to gather as much information as possible and display it in one place, this means the user can ask to the program to collect certain data for them and then download it straight to their computer (this info may be too complicated/too much to be displayed on the website/app). It will also save all the information so that there is always an archive of the information so that even if we can no longer play a game we will still have as much data about it as possible so that we never ever forget that it existed. The program will also collect data on companies and publishers and rate them based on how bad they are. If they have good business practices, they will have a higher rating. The program will also search for how good the development of the game was and it will display that information with a simple graphic somewhere where the end user can’t miss it. For example, it might show a thumbs up or thumbs down near the name of the game to let users know if it was a good or bad development, it could show something silly like a gif of teeth crunching down on a disk to show if the developers were under crunch. If the game is no longer available anywhere to play, then user will be able to download the game off the website/app (with the company’s permission so that it is legal). They could also download alpha builds and beta builds as well a build for each patch. This is so we can see how the game is made and to try and see the thought process of the developers. It is also so we can keep track on which games are released finished as this is something important that should be documented as it can show how far a game has come and how much work the developers have put into the game, or it can show the greediness of some companies. This tool will document every aspect of games, the good and the bad.
    </p>
    <p>We will use Atom as a place to code on as well as we can code together on it and it have lots of packages so we can customise it to how we like. We would use flutter to create the app and the website as its used by big companies such as google, eBay and BMW and it can be used on multiple devices. It is also open source. We will need a cloud database like mongo to store all the information as it would be too expensive to do it ourselves and we don’t have the space. </p>
    <p>We will need skilled programmers who will design and create the program
      as well as a trusted company who is secure and can store all the data
      from the program. We will also need website/app developers and designers,
      so the app runs smoothly and looks great. It might be a bit hard to find
      programmers and designers as the project may be quite difficult for first
      year students however a more basic build would be much easier possible to
      find some programmers. We can easily find a server hosting website that
      is secure with a quick google search.
    </p>

    <p>If the project is successful, then there will be a program that will search the internet looking for everything there is to know about a certain game so that even if a company tries to remove that game it will never be truly gone. By carefully documenting the development process it would be possible to shame companies into adopting better practices as their actions will be immortalised in our program for the entire world to see.</p>
